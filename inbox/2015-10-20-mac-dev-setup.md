1. [Mac OS X Dev Setup](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup)

   This document describes how I set up my developer environment on a new MacBook or iMac.

2. [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate)

   Slate is a window management application similar to Divvy and SizeUp (except better and free!).
